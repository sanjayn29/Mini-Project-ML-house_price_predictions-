House Price Prediction - Linear Regression Model
This project is my first task as a Machine Learning Intern at SkillCraft Technology. The objective of the project is to predict house prices using a linear regression model based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and basement area.

Project Overview
Built a predictive model using the House Price Dataset.
Focused on key features:
GrLivArea (above-ground living area in square feet)
TotalBsmtSF (total basement square footage)
BedroomAbvGr (number of bedrooms)
FullBath (number of full bathrooms)
The target variable is SalePrice, representing the house price.
Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values by filling them with the median.
Selected and processed features for optimal performance.
Model Training:
Implemented a Linear Regression Model using Python's sklearn library.
Achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 46,664 on the validation dataset.
Prediction:
Generated house price predictions for the test dataset.
Exported the results to a CSV file.
Technologies Used
Python: Data processing and model development.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn.
Future Enhancements
Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest.
Perform additional feature engineering to improve accuracy.
Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization techniques.
